## Scope

This is an introductory tutorial to [EasyBuild](https://easybuilders.github.io/easybuild),
a command line tool for installing (scientific) software on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems.

It aims to explain the core concepts of EasyBuild,
get you started with using it, make you familiar with some of the features it provides,
and show how it is used by large HPC sites to maintain their central software stacks.

Through hands-on exercises and demos, you will experience how EasyBuild can help you
to get scientific software installed in an efficient way.
